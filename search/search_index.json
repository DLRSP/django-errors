This will help us quickly identify if there is a valid issue, and make sure that it gets fixed more quickly if there is one.</li> <li>Feature requests will often be closed with a recommendation that they be implemented outside of the core library.  Keeping new feature requests implemented as third party libraries allows us to keep down the maintenance overhead, so that the focus can be on continued stability, bugfixes, and great documentation.</li> <li>Closing an issue doesn't necessarily mean the end of a discussion.

<ol> <li> <p>Suppose to have your model <code>MyBackground</code> to store all your site background's image with a filer field called <code>image</code>.</p> example/models.py<pre><code>from django.db import models\nfrom filer.fields.image import FilerImageField\n\n\nclass MyBackground(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(verbose_name=\"Background\", max_length=50, null=True)\n    image = FilerImageField(null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Upload your images with <code>name</code> like the error's code of the page to be able to dynamically load different images with same html file.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create your own template tags to store the image inside the context view where you want to load image</p> example/templatetags/errors.py<pre><code>from django import template\nfrom django.core.cache import cache\nfrom example.models import MyBackground\n\nregister = template.Library()\n\n\n@register.simple_tag(takes_context=True)\ndef load_error_img(context):\n    cache_key = f\"site_error_{context['error_code']}_context\"\n    try:\n        context_cache = cache.get(cache_key)\n    except Exception as err:\n        context_cache = None\n\n    if context_cache is None:\n        try:\n            custom_context = (\n                MyBackground.objects.values(\"image__file\")\n                .filter(name=context[\"error_code\"])\n                .first()\n            )\n            context_cache = cache.set(\n

context_cache or \"\"\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Create your own html template inside the root of your app. Assign the result of your tag <code>load_error_img</code> into variable <code>error_img</code> and use it with <code>static</code> filter.</p> example/template/errors.html<pre><code>{% extends 'base.html' %}\n{% load static errors %}\n\n{% block content %}\n\n    {% load_error_img as error_img %}\n\n    &lt;div style=\"background-image: url( {% static error_img %} );\"&gt;\n        &lt;strong&gt;Oops! &lt;/strong&gt; {{ error_message }}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n{% endblock content %}\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>(optional) It could be useful use the <code>MEDIA_URL</code> setting inside template. To do it, add the <code>context_processor</code>:</p> settings.py<pre><code>TEMPLATES = [\n    {\n        \"BACKEND\": \"django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates\",\n        \"DIRS\": [os.path.join(PROJECT_DIR, \"templates\")],\n        \"APP_DIRS\": True,\n        \"OPTIONS\": {\n            \"context_processors\": [\n                \"django.template.context_processors.debug\",\n                \"django.template.context_processors.request\",\n                \"django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth\",\n                \"django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages\",\n\"django.template.context_processors.media\",\n],\n        },\n    },\n]\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>(optional) And then use the <code>MEDIA_URL</code> tag inside template instead of <code>static</code> templatetags:</p> example/template/errors.html<pre><code>{% extends 'base.html' %}\n{% load static errors %}\n\n{% block content %}\n\n     {% load_error_img as error_img %}\n\n     &lt;div style=\"background-image: url( {{ MEDIA_URL }}{{ error_img }} );\"&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Oops! &lt;/strong&gt; {{ error_message }}\n     &lt;/div&gt;\n\n{% endblock content %}\n...\n&lt;div style=\"background-image: url( {{ MEDIA_URL }}{{ error_img }} );\"&gt;\n   &lt;strong&gt;Oops! &lt;/strong&gt; {{ error_message }}\n&lt;/div&gt;\n...\n</code></pre> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"tutorial/templates/","title":"Templates","text":"<p>You can overwrite each page's template by create your own html file inside <code>example/templates/errors/404.html</code></p> <p>You can also overwrite one or all page's template by settings your own html file inside <code>settings</code></p> settings.py<pre><code># Custom Templates for all errors page inside the root's templates of my app\nTEMPLATE_ERROR_ALL = \"general_errors_page.html\"\n\n# Custom Templates for only 404 error's inside the root's templates of my app\nTEMPLATE_ERROR_404 = \"other_error_page.html\"\n\n# Custom Templates for only 405 error's inside the custom_app's templates\nTEMPLATE_ERROR_405 = \"custom_app/another_error_page.html\"\n</code></pre> <p>All available <code>settings</code> variables are: settings.py<pre><code>TEMPLATE_ERROR_ALL = \"errors/errors.html\"\nTEMPLATE_ERROR_400 = \"errors/400.html\"\nTEMPLATE_ERROR_403 = \"errors/403.html\"\nTEMPLATE_ERROR_404 = \"errors/404.html\"\nTEMPLATE_ERROR_405 = \"errors/405.html\"\nTEMPLATE_ERROR_500 = \"errors/500.html\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>The order to find template is:</p> <ol> <li>Custom template for specific error page (example: <code>settings.TEMPLATE_ERROR_404</code>)</li> <li>Custom template for all errors page (example: <code>settings.TEMPLATE_ERROR_ALL</code>)</li> <li>Custom template for specific error page by to overwrite default (example: <code>example/templates/errors/404.html</code>)</li> <li>Default template for specific error page</li> </ol>"}]}

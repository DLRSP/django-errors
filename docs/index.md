It's an app to wrap Django errors.

---

## Requirements

These packages are required:

* Python (3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10)
* Django (2.2, 3.2)

We **highly recommend** and only officially support the latest patch release of each Python and Django series.


## Installation

1. Install using `pip`, including any optional packages you want...

    ``` shell
    pip install django-errors
    ```

    ...or clone the project from github.

    ``` shell
    git clone https://github.com/DLRSP/django-errors/
    ```

2. Add `'django_errors'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.

    ``` python title="settings.py"
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'django_errors',
    ]
    ```

3. Add the following to your root `urls.py` file.

    ``` python title="urls.py"
    # ...other imports...
    from django_errors import views as errors_views

    urlpatterns = [
        # ...other urls...
    ]

    handler400 = errors_views.custom_400
    """ Handle 400 error """

    handler403 = errors_views.custom_403
    """ Handle 403 error """

    handler404 = errors_views.custom_404
    """ Handle 404 error """

    handler500 = errors_views.custom_500
    """ Handle 500 error """
    ```

4. If you would like to handle also the "405 - Method not allowed", add the following middleware to your `MIDDLEWARE` setting.

    ``` python title="settings.py"
    MIDDLEWARE = (
        ...
        "django_errors.middleware.handler.HttpResponseNotAllowedMiddleware",
        ...
    )
    ```

5. If you would like to receive email message for "404 - Not Found" error, add the following middleware at **top** to your `MIDDLEWARE` setting.

    ``` python title="settings.py"
    MIDDLEWARE = (
        "django.middleware.common.BrokenLinkEmailsMiddleware",  # <-- Error Manager 404
        ...
    )
    ```
